# 3DPN: Learnable 3D Perlin Noise
This branch is built for the **bounded** setup, if you want to test the **unbounded** setup, please switch branch.

This repository contains an implementation of **3DPN**, a learnable 3D scene representation based on Perlin Noise for image-domain 3D reconstruction.

> We propose 3DPN, a learnable 3D scene representation based on Perlin Noise for image-domain 3D reconstruction. 3DPN models scenes as a spatially continuous volumetric field defined by optimizable gradient vectors on a regular lattice, and rendered via differentiable volumetric rendering. We introduce a complete optimization pipeline, including automatic scene initialization from camera poses, a monotonic and gapless indexing scheme to support both bounded and unbounded scene configurations. To improve reconstruction capacity while maintaining a compact parameterization, we adopt a mixed-resolution formulation that combines multiple noise frequencies within a single volume. Owing to its analytic structure and low parameter size, 3DPN enables efficient rendering with decent frame rates. Experiments on public benchmarks and real-world captures show that 3DPN is particularly effective for compact scenes dominated by a single object, while the unbounded configuration is better suited for larger-scale scenes with extended spatial structure.

## Overview

3DPN proposes a **non-neural, analytic representation** for reconstructing 3D scenes from multi-view images.  
Instead of using deep neural networks, the method models scenes as a **continuous volumetric field based on Perlin Noise**.

The representation is:
- Continuous
- Differentiable
- Compact
- Interpretable

## Usage

### 1. Download Dataset
![sit_11f](/assets/phoneCapture_half.png)

Download the dataset from the official source (see Resources section below).

### 2. Prepare Dataset
Extract the dataset into the `data/` directory following this structure:

```
data/
└── ├── kitchen/
          └── ├── images/
              ├── sparse/
    ├── garden/
    ├── bicycle/
    └── ...
train.py
viewer.py
```

Run the **downsampler.py** (You need to modify the target folder in the code, if you wish to change the **scaling factor**, you also have to modify the **colmap_loader.py** before training)


### 3. Train

```bash
python train.py
```

### 4. Render

```bash
python viewer.py
```
